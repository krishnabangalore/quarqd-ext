Requirements:

 - Python 2.x at /usr/bin/python

 - ansi C compiler

To build single target, using the default native C compiler:

  cd quarqd/src ; make

To build all targets:

  cd quarqd ; make

(This will fail unless you have installed the same cross compilers as me.)


Please report bugs to me.
